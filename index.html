            <p>The process of applying to MBA programs is highly competitive, with applicants vying for limited spots in top-tier schools. Admissions committees consider various factors such as GMAT scores, undergraduate GPAs, and work experience. This project aims to analyze an MBA admissions dataset to identify which factors are most predictive of admission success. By understanding these trends, prospective students can gain insights into which areas to focus on during their applications. Additionally, admissions committees can benefit from streamlined decision-making tools based on historical applicant data. This analysis is particularly relevant as MBA programs globally seek to attract a diverse, qualified pool of candidates amid growing demand for advanced business education. From this dataset, we can gain meaningful information on what it takes for a student to be admitted in such a rigorous and demanding program. This information would be valuable for prospective students to start preparing if they are interested in applying to this MBA program or a similar one.</p>

            <p>The data set we are choosing to use is the Wharton Class of 2025 MBA Admission Dataset on Kaggle. We would have liked to use one for NEU, but we could not find any readily accessible datasets of the correct parameters. This dataset has 10 attributes, and over 6000 entries, which we have cleaned and filtered to reach less than the 5000 entries detailed in the assignment. A few of the most important columns that we anticipated using during the research/exploration part of this project are Gender, Admissions, GPA, Work Experience, and Major. There were a few null values mainly within the Admission and Race column but that was dealt with by replacing all of the null values in the Admissions columns with 'Rejected'. This was appropriate since the only other values in that column were Waitlist and Admit so it made sense to replace Null with Rejected. After this step there were still a few null values left in the Race column, and we removed those rows since there were very few null values left. After these data cleaning steps, we were left with around 4300 rows. This dataset is substantial and will give us a lot of room for investigation into what makes a student get into such a prestigious MBA program.

                  <p>This histogram of accepted applicant's GPAs is very helpful for prospect students. We can see that a majority of students have 3.2 or higher GPA, with a majority in the 3.3-3.4 range. Prospect MBA applicants should aim to have a GPA of 3.35 or above to be in the upper 50% of applicants. The curve is normally distributed around this mean. However, we can also see that there are accepted students with GPAs as low as around 2.9 GPA, which is also helpful for students with lower GPAs to know there is still a chance. If a student finds themselves in the lower ranges, they should focus on improving their other qualities like work experience or GMAT score for better chances.</p>

                  <p>The above visualization has 2 subplots that represent the number of applicants who are accepted and rejected into the MBA program, segmented by gender and race. By setting a common y axis on both plots, the comparison becomes much clearer, and we are able to assess the differences between gender and race demographics. The charts express a trend of most applicants being White and Asian, reflected in both accepted and rejected applicants. The biggest demographic of general applicants are rejected white male applicants. Another thing the graphs show is that black applicants, both male and female, have more rejections proportionately to the other groups.

                  <p>This graph is meant to display the admission results solely looking at the amount of work
                    experience the applicant had. What was interesting about this graph was that the mean amount
                    of work experience for each admissions category was 5 across the board. In fact, the Admitted
                    column actually had the lowest amount of work experience with someone having only 1 work
                    experience. This goes to show that work experience definitely is not the most important part of
                    the application and while it can still boost your resume, other components such as GPA and
                    GMAT score are definitely weighed more heavily. This was very interesting since we had
                    previously thought that work experience would be taken more seriously into consideration for
                    this application. I think some other components that might go into this would be the quality of the
                    work experience; someone might only have 1 work experience but it could have been very
                    impressive. Or an applicant might have an excellent GPA and GMAT score to make up for that
                    part of the application</p>

            <p>After investigating our dataset, we have come to a few interesting conclusions supported by our visualizations. The first conclusion we came to was that GPA and the GMAT score of each applicant is arguably two of the most important aspects when it comes to deciding the application result. After analyzing the interactive scatter plot that compared GMAT and GPA, we found that the majority of applicants had a very high GPA and a corresponding high GMAT score. However, it is important to point out that there were also students that didnâ€™t have great standardized scores that were admitted and this was likely due to other factors in their application that made them stand out. The next attribute we looked into was if work experience affected the admissions results. From this graph we realized that work experience was not that high priority on the list of attributes and did not affect the outcome of the admissions results that substantially. The next thing we investigated was how race and gender affected the admissions results and we found that less women applied in general to this program and as a result, less women were accepted. So while the same percentage of men and women were admitted, less women were accepted overall due to the lack of applications. Other than that there were no significant discrepancies with the race attribute. Overall, we found that GPA and GMAT score affected the admissions results the most significantly out of all of the attributes.
